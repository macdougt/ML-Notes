| Term          | Description|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| Softmax      | a form of logistic regression that normalizes an input value into a vector of values that follows a probability distribution whose total sums up to 1. |
| one-hot as defined for encoding     | a group of bits among which the legal combinations of values are only those with a single high (1) bit and all the others low (0)      |
|Dropout | the process of randomly disconnecting nodes from the current layer to the next layer. This process of random disconnects naturally helps the network to reduce overfitting as no one single node in the layer will be responsible for predicting a certain class, object, edge, or corner.|
